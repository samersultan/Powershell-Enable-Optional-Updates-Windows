# Enable "Get the latest updates as soon as they're available" in Windows 11

This PowerShell script enables the **"Get the latest updates as soon as they're available"** feature on Windows 11 by setting a specific registry value.

## 🛠️ What It Does

The script modifies the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings
```

It sets the `IsContinuousInnovationOptedIn` DWORD value to `1`, which opts the system into receiving the latest updates as soon as they're available.
